# Setting the camera and background in the game in godot 

* We go to the character scene and add the camera2D node to the character in Godot and set the **Current** option on.
* We turn off the drag margins as well, thus we have a basic camera set up in the game!
* Then we select the background of the game add it with **parallex bakcground** node and then adding the sky with it, make the center and transform to (0,0) and set the stuffs basically.
