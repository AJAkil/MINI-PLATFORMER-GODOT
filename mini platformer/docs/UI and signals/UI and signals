# Making a UI and Signals in Godot

## MENU

* Create a node scene and save the node scene. we can move the center around that would basically change the margin.
* The **layout** option will help us choose the anchor of the control node. SO That the anchor will change when screen will change the size.
* Select a **center container** and then select the layout to be **full sized** so anything we place on the center will be on the center of the screen.
* Then write the option labels
* Create a script for the start menu and also a script for the start button you want to press and start the game. 
* Then establish an event call for the button to be pressed called signal in Godot. We create an event for the start button and then we add the start menu scene as the end point of that signal.
